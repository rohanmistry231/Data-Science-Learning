    "A variable is a named location used to **store data in the memory**. Variable also known as **identifier** and used to hold value. It is helpful to think of variables as a container that holds data that can be changed later in the program. **Mnemonic** variables are recommended to use in many programming languages. A mnemonic variable is a variable name that can be easily remembered and associated. A variable refers to a memory address in which data is stored. For example,\n",

    "In this training, I will use standard Python variable naming style which has been adopted by many Python developers. Python developers use snake case(snake_case) variable naming convention. We use underscore character after each word for a variable containing more than one word (eg. **`first_name`**, **`last_name`**, **`engine_rotation_speed`**).  Below is an example of standard naming of variables, underscore is required when the variable name is more than one word.\n",
